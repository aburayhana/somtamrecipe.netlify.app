Hello everybody, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, valenciana. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Valenciana is one of the most favored of current trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is simple, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Valenciana is something that I have loved my entire life.

Arroz Valenciana is a hearty and tasty Filipino dish made of glutinous rice, coconut milk, chicken, Chorizo de Bilbao, and saffron. Colorful and festive, it&#39;s perfect for holidays and special occasions! The real Paella Valenciana doesn&#39;t have green peas, but you can add, when its the season, artichoke in quarters. Someone told you to add a bit of lemon juice over it before eating the paella, and I agree it makes the flavour more intense, but the acid of the lemon combined with the carbohydrates of the rice makes your digestion difficult.


To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have valenciana using 13 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook that.
