- "Heat a deep sided 10in. skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef/turkey and begin to brown, breaking into a fine crumble as you go. When meat is about half cooked add chopped onion. Continue cooking until meat is browned, stirring frequently. About 8 - 10 minutes total. Drain, do not rinse, and return to skillet."

- "Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray the bottom of a 9x9in. casserole dish with cooking spray. Pour half the jar of salsa in the dish and swirl to coat bottom."

- "Spoon one quarter of the meat mixture into a &#34;log&#34; shape across center of tortilla. Fold about 1/2in each of left and right sides of tortilla over meat mixture. Bring bottom side up over meat and finish rolling snuggly into a burrito shape. Tuck in any loose edges on the ends and place seam side down in dish."
- "Repeat process with remaining tortillas and mixes, adjusting enchiladas in dish as necessary to ensure all fit in same direction completely (usually have to &#34;slide&#34; mine over to make enough room)."
- "When all enchiladas are in dish top with remaining salsa, spread to coat evenly, then sprinkle with remaining 1 cup cheese. Add sliced black olives if desired. Tent with aluminum foil, making sure you don&#39;t touch the cheese. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 15 minutes more or until top is golden and bubbly. Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes before serving. We do 1 enchilada per person if not having sides, 1/2 per person with sides."

- "VARIATION, Layered Enchilada Pie: Spray 9in deep dish pie plate with cooking spray. Pour one quarter of jar of salsa in bottom and swirl to coat. Place one tortilla on top of salsa. Spread one third of the meat mixture on tortilla. Dollop one third of the cream cheese mixture in small pieces all over meat. Top with another tortilla, quarter jar of the salsa, and third each of meat and cream cheese mixture. Repeat for a third layer, but skip salsa to save remaining half jar for the top. Top your third layer of mixes with the final tortilla, last of the salsa (letting some run over the edges) and remaining 1 cup of shredded cheese (optional olives) in that order. Bake exactly the same as if they&#39;re rolled and enjoy!"
