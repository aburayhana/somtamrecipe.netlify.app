- "3 tsp Sugar"

recipeinstructions:
- "Pressure cook the Toor Dal (pigeon peas) in enough water until it is completely soft. Mix into a rough paste. The amount of water depends on the brand of lentils.

- "Add the tamarind pulp, okra and the chillies to a pot, and add just enough water to barely soak the Okra."

- "Bring it to a boil. Continue cooking covered on medium heat until Okra starts getting a rusty green color."
- "Once that happens, add in the majority of the cilantro, saving some for garnish"
- "Continue cooking for about a minute. Then add the Toor dal paste."
- "Once this comes to a boil, add the asafoetida, and turn off the heat. Add the remaining cilantro, and keep it covered."
- "Now start preparing the tempering. in a small pan, take the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the Urad dal. Add the mustard seeds. Once the seeds start crackling, add the dried red chillies. take the pan off the heat."
- "Add the curry leaves and the asafoetida. Be careful as the oil will splash around vigorously"
- "Pour the tempering over the Sambar and keep it covered until serving."
- "Serve with plain rice for a wholesome meal."
- "Bon Apetit!"
