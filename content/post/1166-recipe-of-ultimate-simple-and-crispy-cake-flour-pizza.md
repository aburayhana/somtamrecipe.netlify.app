- "Thinly spread out the dough in a circle.  Keep it covered with plastic wrap while you prepare your favorite sauce and toppings."
- "Prick the dough with a fork (to keep the ingredients from falling off), add in the ingredients, and cook in the toaster oven or oven until golden brown (at 200℃ for about 10-15 minutes)."
