Transfer into a piping bag."

- "Transfer onto serving plate toasted side down.  Remove the mousse from the freezer.  Carefully, using a blow torch to heat up the pastry ring for easy unmolding.  Slide the mousse onto the toasted bread."
- "Pipe the meringue onto the mousse.  Decorate the sides with toasted coconut flakes.  Lastly, carefully blowtorch the meringue until lightly browned.  Serve immediately."
