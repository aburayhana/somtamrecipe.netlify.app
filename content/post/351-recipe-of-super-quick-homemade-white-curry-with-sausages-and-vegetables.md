recipeingredient:
- "250 g chicken sausage diced"
- "3 red peppers diced"
- "1 stalk broccoli chopped I used the stalks as well"
- "1.5 glass (375 ml) whole milk original recipe usually calls for coconut milk"
- "2 tbsp vegetable oil"
- "1.5 medium onion or shallots if you have that"
- "4 cloves garlic"
- "4 candlenuts if you have this Other nuts can work as replacement"
- "1 tsp galangal paste if you have this If not maybe ginger"
- "to taste pepper"
- "1 tsp coriander"
- " very small pinch of cumin"
- "to taste salt"
- " lime juice or kaffir lime leaf if you have that crunched"
- "2-3 bayleaves if you have this"
- "1 lemongrass stalk if you have this flatten with knife"
- "1 block vegetable stock cube"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop all ingredients. You can replace them with other proteins or vegetables. I suggest about 500g worth of ingredients as I think I put too much of them, resulting in less broth."
- "Chop onion and garlic until small. Break the candlenuts, using your blunt knife&#39;s edge. Mix all spices except the bay leaves, lemongrass, and lime juice. If you have pestle and mortar or a food processor, that&#39;ll be even better."
- "You can skip this step, but I like to have the vegetables and the sausage charred a bit. Prepare a wok or medium pot. Heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil. Stir fry the vegetables and the sausage in high heat, only until they change colour. Set aside."
- "Heat the remaining vegetable oil. Add the spices over low heat. Stir a bit and wait until you can smell the spices. Add the vegetables and the sausage (or if you want, you can put the vegetables first). Then add the milk, then the bay leaves and the lemongrass stalk."
- "Wait until it boils in low heat. Taste to correct the salt/ pepper. Add lemon juice. Will be good to eat with rice or porridge, but rice noodles or just noodles are alright as well."
