recipeingredient:
- "1/2 Green mango"
- "1 Cucumber"
- "2 bunch Watercress or mesclun"
- "1 tbsp Pine nuts or your choice of nuts"
- " For the dressing"
- "3 tbsp Allpurpose fish sauce"
- "4 Dried shrimp"
- "1 Cilantro"
- "2 tsp Grapeseed oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "This mango is very big! It was too bad that it&#39;s a little ripe already, but since I usually don&#39;t see them sold, I just had to buy it."
- "The color of the skin is still green even when it&#39;s ripe inside and it&#39;s hard to judge from the outside.  This mango was already ripe enough to eat it straight."
- "Ordinarily, this dish is made with an unripe and sour mango, but since it was already sweet, I added some cucumber, too! Peel and julienne the cucumber into the same size as the mango."
- "I also added watercress to give the sweet mango a little kick. Rinse and drain the watercress and gently toss it in."
- "Transfer it to a serving bowl and sprinkle on the pine nuts. Chopped peanuts are used for the genuine Som Tam, but I had a lot of pine nuts."
- "Drizzle on the Som Tam dressing and it is done. If you like cilantro, you can substitute it instead of watercress. I don&#39;t really like it, so I added just a little in the sauce..."
- "[To make the salad dressing] Soak the dried shrimp in a bowl of water to rehydrate and finely chop. The cilantro can be either fresh or dried."
- "Blend it evenly with the fish sauce. Add the oil to your preference."
