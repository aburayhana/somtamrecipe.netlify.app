Great recipe for Secret Heart Roll Cake. I thought about making Valentine&#39;s Day treats using cream cheese. I also wanted to try making this kind of roll cake and somehow the two ideas blended together. If your strawberries don&#39;t give it much of a pink colour, you can top the colour up with pink. This rolled cake (aka Swiss roll cake or Deco roll) can be made in chocolate or regular plain cake. (For the plain sponge cake recipe click here).
