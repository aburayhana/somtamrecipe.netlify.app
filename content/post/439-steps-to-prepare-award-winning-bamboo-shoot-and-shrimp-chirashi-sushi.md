- "3 Eggs"
- "4 tbsp White toasted sesame seeds"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the rice to a somewhat firm texture (to do this, just use a little less water than usual) in a rice cooker. Add a little salt, sugar, and whatever seasonings you like (suggestions are mirin or dashi stock) to the egg, and cook thin omelets. Julienne to make shredded eggs, and set aside. Discard the heads and tails of the shrimp, blanch in salt water, chop up, and set aside. Blanch the snow peas in salt water, cut diagonally (like in the picture), and set aside."
- "[Simmer the mixed ingredients] Reconstitute the dried shiitake mushrooms and koya dofu by soaking in lukewarm water, then drain. Cut the shiitake mushrooms, koya dofu, carrot, and bamboo shoot into small pieces, and set aside. The bamboo shoots should be cut a little larger than the other items. Then put all of these ingredients into a pot, add all of the seasonings and broth ingredients marked with ★, and simmer until most of the liquid is gone."
- "Put the four ingredients marked with ● into a microwave-safe bowl, microwave for about 30 seconds, and stir.  (For the Sushi vinegar)  Turn out the freshly steamed, hot rice into a hangiri (wooden sushi tub), and add sushi vinegar in 3-4 batches while fanning the rice with a hand-held fan. Mixing the rice and vinegar with a spatula, using a cutting motion."
- "Add the simmered ingredients from Step 2 to the sushi rice from Step 3, toasted white sesame seeds, and mix well. When it&#39;s evenly mixed, scatter on the julienned egg crepe, add the chopped shrimp and snow peas on top, and it&#39;s done."
- "Add further toppings as you like. Garnish with nanohana, slices of raw fish, etc., to taste. I prefer my sushi rice a little on the tart side. If you don&#39;t like it so tart, just cut back on the amount of vinegar a bit."
