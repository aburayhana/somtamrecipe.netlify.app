recipeinstructions:
- "Form half of the rice into an egg-shaped ball. [Set aside a finger-tip sized amount]"

- "Cut a long, thin piece of thin omelet out and wrap around a rice ball (with the right side on top)."
- "Slice the top part of the smoked salmon horizontally (if you don&#39;t mind the bloody parts, you can use it as-is)."
- "Wrap the salmon around the egg, making sure the egg peaks out a bit."
- "Wrap around the remaining salmon in the back. When you&#39;ve finished wrapping it, wrap in plastic wrap and let set."
- "Repeat the process with the other rice ball, using smoked salmon for the bottom layer, nori for the top. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and squeeze to set."

- "Using a knife or kitchen scissors, cut 1 cm slits every 5 mm along the folded edge (don&#39;t cut the inside!)"
- "Starting at one end, wrap it up. Once wrapped up, use a piece of dry pasta to secure it with the loops facing out."
- "Stick in a piece of pasta."
- "Stick 13 and 14 to the dolls&#39; heads. (The pasta will soften by the time you eat it.)"
- "Cut the eyes and mouths out with nori and stick on the faces. Use the denbu for the cheeks. If you don&#39;t have denbu, use ketchup instead."
- "If you have the energy to do so, make the fan and scale from the remaining thin omelet. They will stick naturally to the dolls."
- "All done!"
- "The picture shows the old sitting arrangement. Now in the Kanto region, it seems that it&#39;s fashionable to have the girl doll sitting on the right side."
