- " Sushi Rice"
- "3 cups 180 ml cup Japanese Short Grain Rice"
- "75 ml Rice Vinegar"
- "60 g Sugar about 4 tablespoons"
- "1  14 teaspoons Salt"
- " Topping  Filling"
- "200 g Smoke Salmon"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1 Avocado thinly sliced"
recipeinstructions:
- "When you cook rice for sushi, cook with slightly less amount of water to achieve firmer texture. Basically you need same volume of rice and water. If you are using Rice Cooker, set the water level slightly lower than the mark. When rice is cooked, you need to let the rice steamed well. *Note: Wash rice well before cooking."
- "Make Sushi Vinegar by mixing the ingredients together. Pour the Sushi Vinegar over the HOT rice, then empty it into a large mixing bowl. Mix it well gently and thoroughly, fanning the rice with a fan or piece of cardboard to help the rice cool quickly. Cover the rice with a damp cloth to stop the rice drying out."
- "Cook Eggs. Make thin omelettes or scrambled eggs."
- "Line a square food container with plastic food wrap. Lay out the Smoked Salmon slices, overlapping, on the base. Spread some rice evenly to cover the salmon, then spread the cooked Egg, then arrange the Avocado slices evenly. Cover with rice."
- "Place plastic food wrap on top, and press it down evenly with your hand, a large spoon or something flat. I use a small chopping board. *Note: You need to press quite firmly, otherwise the sushi pieces will collapse into pieces when you eat them."
- "Remove the top plastic wrap, and turn out the block of sushi onto a chopping board. Remove the plastic wrap and cut it into bite sized pieces with a sharp knife. The knife becomes very sticky, so you need to wipe it frequently with a wet cloth or wet paper towel."

![Oshi-zushi](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/8294212bd4c60d1a/751x532cq70/oshi-zushi-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, hope you're having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, oshi-zushi. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Oshi-zushi is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look fantastic. Oshi-zushi is something that I have loved my whole life.

Oshi-zushi are squares of rice pressed in a mold and topped with smoked or cooked fish. The mold is usually made of wood, but metal pans used for layered cakes serve as good substitutes. But you don&#39;t need the special mould. I use a plastic container and a small chopping board to press.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have oshi-zushi using 9 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.
