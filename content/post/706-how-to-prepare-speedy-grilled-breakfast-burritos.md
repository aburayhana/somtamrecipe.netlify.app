recipeinstructions:
- "First, clean your potatoes (I leave the skin on and just wash them extra well), and then chop into small squares. *Do the potatoes first because they usually take the longest."
- "Heat some olive oil in a wok on low-med. *You can use a frying pan - I chose a wok so that I could mix my potatoes around to get an even fry."
- "While the oil is heating up, chop the onions how you like (I chop mine into little squares)."
- "Once the oil is heated, add the potatoes &amp; the onions and turn heat up to medium. Here is where i add some seasonings also - the garlic, season salt, etc. *Make sure to keep a close eye on everything and stir frequently to prevent burning. You may need to add a little extra olive oil too during this process."
- "While the potatoes &amp; onions are cooking, crack your eggs into a bowl, add milk, &amp; whisk until well blended."
- "Spray a non-stick frying pan with PAM, turn your burner heat to medium, and add the egg mixture, and cover with a lid."
- "I let my eggs cook without stirring them until they resemble a sloppy omelette in process. At this point, I turn the heat down a little bit and slowly move the eggs around so they don&#39;t start to burn. I then cover them again to let them finish cooking. *The reason I use this process is because I like my eggs fluffy and in large, bouncy chunks. Everyone seems to love my eggs &amp; think I do something &#34;special&#34; to them, but really I just exercise a little patience lol ðŸ˜‰"
- "Once the eggs are done cooking, add your cheeses (I go overboard lol), turn off the heat and cover them to let the cheese melt."
- "Once both the eggs &amp; potatoes are ready, lay a tortilla shell on a plate, drizzle it with dressing, then load it up with &#39;tatoes &amp; eggs! (I do potatoes first, then eggs on top)."
- "Wrap up the tortilla up burrito style, spray the outside of it with some PAM, and place it in another PAM sprayed skillet with heat on low."
- "Brown to your liking, and be careful when turning it over to brown the other side so as not to bust the ends open."
- "If you like hot sauces, grab those up, and you are now ready to smash! We totally loaded our plates.....my eyes had big plans for this one, but sadly i could only destroy half of one burrito lol ....don&#39;t judge ðŸ˜‰"
- "Amazingness!!! ðŸ’ž"
- "Omg yum! ðŸ˜‹"
- "Omg, I&#39;m sooo full lol ðŸ˜“"
