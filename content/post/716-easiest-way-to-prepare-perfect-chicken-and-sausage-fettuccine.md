While this is happening, saute and cook your meats in the same pan you did your vegetables in. You can also add more butter. Because you will need this  and the juices when ready to create the sauce.

Anyway, let the sauce simmer on medium for about 5 min."
- "Then add all your meats, and veggies, rotel(if using) and let simmer on low for about 10-15 min. Be sure to stir around a good bit. Then you can add some of your drained noodles, and stir and let get mixed up and simmered. Or you can just plate your noodles and pour some of the mixture on top. However you prefer. Then top it with more seasonings, cheese or whatever:)"
