recipeingredient:
- "1/2 onion chopped"
- "1 packages Portabello Mushrooms or baby bellas"
- "3 bunch of any type of mushrooms just dont use white button mushrooms"
- " chicken stock"
- "1/4 cup white wine cooking wine"
- " worcestershire sauce"
- "1/3 packages butter"
- "1 pinch garlic cloves"
- "2 dash black pepper"
- " Sea Salt"
- "2 tsp olive oil extra virgin"
- "1/2 can Campbells Golden Mushroom Soup"
- "1 can Campbells Cream of Mushroom Soup"
- "1 can Sliced mushrooms"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take half an onion and chop it and toss it in a frying pan with the olive oil. Set it on the lowest heat and try not to burn the onions. If they do burn its ok but pick out the really charred ones and throw them out."
- "If you really like the flavor onions give then cut the other half of the onion. Don&#39;t throw it in yet though. Add some of a stick of butter in... Probably just a little more than a thin slice.. As the oil is going to disappear within a few mins of frying the chopped onions. After 5 mins of cooking onions add in a ton of different mushrooms like cremini and Portobello tops and oyster tops and shiitake mushrooms (make sure to rinse these mushrooms in a strainer first as well as cut the bigger ones into smaller chunks) and fry it on low heat with the onions.. Also this is the time to add the additional onion as well as the white wine, garlic, salt and black pepper..."
- "After 3mins add some chicken stock to really bring out the nice mushrooms flavor as well as 2-3 squirts of worstishire sauce. Make sure you are stirrings all your mushrooms and onions around your pan all the time to reduce burning."
- "Turn off the heat after making sure all your onions have been cooked to either a golden or translucent color.. However even those crispy brown  edges ones will work too. Put that delicious smelling mixture into the blender and move on to the second part. The cheating part."
- "In a medium sized pot mix half of the cambells golden mushroom soup and a full can of just regular either pregresso or cambells cream of mushroom soup together in a pot on the stove.. And add 1 can of chopped mushrooms drained well actually keep some of the mushroom water and put it in the pot with the two soups..  heat it a bit till it bubbles on the side.. And put. That into the blender too and press puree..."
- "If the puree gets stuck in the blender add more chicken stock and keep pureeing it until you like the consistency. Then use whatever you want to serve it in.. I used/made French bread bowls. Also for extra garnish sprinkle some parsley flakes on top and add more salt if you need to. Enjoy."
