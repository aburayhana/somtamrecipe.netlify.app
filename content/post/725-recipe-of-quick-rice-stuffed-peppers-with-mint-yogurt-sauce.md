recipeingredient:
- " stuffed peppers"
- "3 red bell peppers"
- "1/3 cup pine nuts"
- "1 tsp butter or oil"
- "1 onion finely chopped"
- "2 clove garlic finely chopped"
- "1 tbsp ground coriander"
- "2 tsp ground cumin"
- "2 tsp ground tumeric"
- "3 clove ground or leave them whole if you dont mind spitting them out when you eat"
- "1 hot chilli finely chopped optional"
- "3/4 cup rice I use brown but basmati is good too"
- "2 1/2 cup chicken stock"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "1/4 cup fresh parsley or a couple of tbs of dried"
- "1 pinch pepper"
- "1 pinch salt I omit this due to the chicken stock having salt"
- "1 fresh mint leaves to garnish"
- " mint yogurt sauce"
- "1 cup yogurt preferably Greek"
- "1/3 cup mint leaves chopped"
- "2 tbsp lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dry-fry pine nuts over a medium heat until lightly toasted, about two minutes. Keep separate until later."
- "Heat butter or oil and add onion and garlic, and the chilli if using. Cook for a few minutes until just soft, stirring often so as to not burn the garlic."
- "Add the coriander, cumin and tumeric. If using ground cloves, add now too. Cook for about 30 seconds or until the spices smell aromatic, stirring."
- "Add the uncooked rice and stir to coat with the spices, then pour in the stock. Add bay leaves and whole cloves, if you didn&#39;t already add ground cloves. Bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer, then cook covered for 30 minutes for brown rice or 15 minutes for white. Cook until the rice is cooked through and the stock is absorbed. Add more stock if the rice is getting too dry before it is cooked. (I sometimes use 1.5 cups of cooked leftover brown rice, so I halve the amount of stock and the time to cook.)"
- "Let the rice cool for a few minutes, and if it has clumped, use a fork to separate the grains. Remove bay leaves, and if you used whole cloves, remove them too (if you can find them, lol). Stir in the parsley and pine nuts, and pepper and salt."
- "Halve the peppers and remove the stalks, seeds and membrane. Scoop the rice into the pepper halves, and if you have leftover mix, add extra to the peppers to make them heaped. Cook in a medium oven for 30 to 40 minutes, remove from oven when the peppers are tender and probably slightly charred."
- "While the peppers are cooking, mix the yogurt, mint and lemon. Serve peppers with a generous dollop of the yogurt mix, and a few mint leaves to garnish. Some people prefer it without the yogurt mix (not me), so you may like to taste it before adding the yogurt."
- "Eat with a knife and fork if you like the pepper skin. If you don&#39;t like the skin, use a spoon to scoop the rice and pepper flesh out, it should separate easily after having been in the oven."
