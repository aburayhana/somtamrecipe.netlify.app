recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the chickpeas in water. Dice the onion into large pieces, mince the green chili peppers, ginger, and garlic, then prepare the roux as you would for making tomato and potato based curries. Add the whole spices marked with ※, powdered spices marked with #, and salt. Then, add the vegetable oil to taste. I recommend using 7 tablespoons!!"

- "P.S.: Here&#39;s the secret to our family&#39;s curry. Mash about 1/3 of the chickpeas with a ladle to enhance the creaminess of the soup. This will help the chickpeas blend well with the soup, and allow you to thoroughly enjoy the spicy roux."
