recipeinstructions:
- "Make&#34;Caramelized Onions&#34;. You can make caramelized onions, which are usually very tedious, in about 15 minutes without fail using this method, so I recommend it.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143607-oil-free-easy-and-timesaving-caramelized-onions"
- "I often use frozen batches of the caramelized onion. If it&#39;s too much work for you though, you can use 80 g of storebought caramelized onions."
- "Chop up the garlic finely as indicated in the ingredient list."
- "Put the extra virgin olive oil and garlic in a cold frying pan. Use low heat, and slowly transfer the fragrance of the garlic to the oil."
- "When the garlic smells nice, add the ground meat to the pan. Sprinkle in the nutmeg and the B. seasoning ingredients generously. Sauté the meat over medium heat until crumbly."
- "Add the red wine and cook over high heat until it has reduced, then put in the canned tomatoes and the B. onions."
- "Put the soup stock cubes, the Step 1 caramelized onions and water. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low-medium heat for about 5 minutes. If there&#39;s too much liquid, simmer for a while longer."
- "Add the curry roux pieces, and lower the heat so that it won&#39;t burn. Stir to dissolve the roux. Add the A. seasoning ingredients to finish, and the sauce is done."
- "I use this curry roux; 1 piece is this size. Taste the sauce after adding the roux, and if you want it to taste more curry-like add more roux, 1 piece at a time."
- "Cook the pasta al dente, drain and mix with the sauce. Serve."
- "This is like a combination of regular bolognese sauce and qeema curry. The two types of onion added make it taste so good, and it&#39;s quite addictive."
- "Serve with a generous amount of the sauce. It&#39;s great for lunch on your own, but it&#39;s really well suited to being served on a big platter to be enjoyed by a crowd."
- "This sauce is delicious on pizza or in gratinéed dishes. It can be frozen too, so I recommend making a large batch of it."
